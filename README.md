Fun Date Invite — The Project You Send When “No” Is Not an Option**

Some pages sit there quietly.

This one fights back.

It dodges “No.”
It negotiates.
It panics.
It gets dramatic.
It acts cute.
It acts toxic.
It acts like your best friend *and* your worst decision — all in JavaScript.

This is a date invite generator**, but it behaves like a character in its own rom-com.

You enter your name → it creates a personal link → you send it →
and when they open it, the page starts… performing.

They try pressing No?
The button gets confused. Then emotional. Then philosophical.

They press Yes?
Now we’re cooking.

The page opens a whole selection of date ideas — Movies, Coffee, Drive, Street Food, Desserts, Activities, Drinks, even “Kidnap Style” (calm down, it's a joke… mostly).

Each choice comes with a caption that sounds less like AI and more like a friend exposing your crush:

```
IMAX – Screen kante ne face ekkuva bright.  
Pizza – Thoda cheesy, thoda easy… bilkul ham jaise.  
Mocktail – Nijaalu matladukundama?  
Movie Night – Nuvu movie chudu… nenu mataram ninnu chustha.
Kidnap Style – Just kidding… maybe.
```

Every option is a tiny personality test disguised as a joke.

When they finally choose something?
Boom — date locked. No running now.

## Why This Exists

Because sometimes:

* Texting “Wanna go out?” is scary
* People freeze
* And code needs to flirt too

This project makes sure your invite is:

* Hard to ignore
* Impossible to reject (emotionally or logically)
* Dramatic enough to be remembered
* Cute enough to soften the blow
* And funny enough to get a “fine, okay 😭”
